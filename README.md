# `create-theorem` - Initializing theorem-like environments with multilingual support

The package `create-theorem` provides the commands `\NameTheorem` and `\CreateTheorem` for naming and initializing theorem-like environments. They both have key-value based interface and are especially useful in multi-language documents, allowing you to easily declare theorem-like environments that automatically adapt to the language settings.
